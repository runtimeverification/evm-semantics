Network State
=============

This file represents all the network state present in the EVM.
It will incrementally build up to supporting the entire [EVM-C API].

```k
module NETWORK
    imports STRING-SYNTAX

    syntax String ::= StatusCode2String(StatusCode) [symbol(StatusCode2String), function]
 // -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

EVM Status Codes
----------------

### Exceptional Codes

The following codes all indicate that the VM ended execution with an exception, but give details about how.

-   `EVMC_FAILURE` is a catch-all for generic execution failure.
-   `EVMC_INVALID_INSTRUCTION` indicates reaching the designated `INVALID` opcode.
-   `EVMC_UNDEFINED_INSTRUCTION` indicates that an undefined opcode has been reached.
-   `EVMC_OUT_OF_GAS` indicates that execution exhausted the gas supply.
-   `EVMC_BAD_JUMP_DESTINATION` indicates a `JUMP*` to a non-`JUMPDEST` location.
-   `EVMC_STACK_OVERFLOW` indicates pushing more than 1024 elements onto the wordstack.
-   `EVMC_STACK_UNDERFLOW` indicates popping elements off an empty wordstack.
-   `EVMC_CALL_DEPTH_EXCEEDED` indicates that we have executed too deeply a nested sequence of `CALL*` or `CREATE` opcodes.
-   `EVMC_INVALID_MEMORY_ACCESS` indicates that a bad memory access occurred.
    This can happen when accessing local memory with `CODECOPY*` or `CALLDATACOPY`, or when accessing return data with `RETURNDATACOPY`.
-   `EVMC_STATIC_MODE_VIOLATION` indicates that a `STATICCALL` tried to change state.
    **TODO:** Avoid `_ERROR` suffix that suggests fatal error.
-   `EVMC_PRECOMPILE_FAILURE` indicates an errors in the precompiled contracts (eg. invalid points handed to elliptic curve functions).
-   `EVMC_INVALID_BLOCK` indicates malformed or wrong transaction data or block data

```k
    syntax ExceptionalStatusCode ::= "EVMC_FAILURE"
                                   | "EVMC_INVALID_INSTRUCTION"
                                   | "EVMC_UNDEFINED_INSTRUCTION"
                                   | "EVMC_OUT_OF_GAS"
                                   | "EVMC_BAD_JUMP_DESTINATION"
                                   | "EVMC_STACK_OVERFLOW"
                                   | "EVMC_STACK_UNDERFLOW"
                                   | "EVMC_CALL_DEPTH_EXCEEDED"
                                   | "EVMC_INVALID_MEMORY_ACCESS"
                                   | "EVMC_STATIC_MODE_VIOLATION"
                                   | "EVMC_PRECOMPILE_FAILURE"
                                   | "EVMC_NONCE_EXCEEDED"
                                   | "EVMC_INVALID_BLOCK"
 // -----------------------------------------------------
    rule StatusCode2String(EVMC_FAILURE)               => "EVMC_FAILURE"
    rule StatusCode2String(EVMC_INVALID_INSTRUCTION)   => "EVMC_INVALID_INSTRUCTION"
    rule StatusCode2String(EVMC_UNDEFINED_INSTRUCTION) => "EVMC_UNDEFINED_INSTRUCTION"
    rule StatusCode2String(EVMC_OUT_OF_GAS)            => "EVMC_OUT_OF_GAS"
    rule StatusCode2String(EVMC_BAD_JUMP_DESTINATION)  => "EVMC_BAD_JUMP_DESTINATION"
    rule StatusCode2String(EVMC_STACK_OVERFLOW)        => "EVMC_STACK_OVERFLOW"
    rule StatusCode2String(EVMC_STACK_UNDERFLOW)       => "EVMC_STACK_UNDERFLOW"
    rule StatusCode2String(EVMC_CALL_DEPTH_EXCEEDED)   => "EVMC_CALL_DEPTH_EXCEEDED"
    rule StatusCode2String(EVMC_INVALID_MEMORY_ACCESS) => "EVMC_INVALID_MEMORY_ACCESS"
    rule StatusCode2String(EVMC_STATIC_MODE_VIOLATION) => "EVMC_STATIC_MODE_VIOLATION"
    rule StatusCode2String(EVMC_PRECOMPILE_FAILURE)    => "EVMC_PRECOMPILE_FAILURE"
    rule StatusCode2String(EVMC_NONCE_EXCEEDED)        => "EVMC_NONCE_EXCEEDED"
    rule StatusCode2String(EVMC_INVALID_BLOCK)         => "EVMC_INVALID_BLOCK"
```

### Ending Codes

These additional status codes indicate that execution has ended in some non-exceptional way.

-   `EVMC_SUCCESS` indicates successful end of execution.
-   `EVMC_REVERT` indicates that the contract called `REVERT`.

```k
    syntax EndStatusCode ::= ExceptionalStatusCode
                           | "EVMC_SUCCESS"
                           | "EVMC_REVERT"
 // --------------------------------------
    rule StatusCode2String(EVMC_SUCCESS) => "EVMC_SUCCESS"
    rule StatusCode2String(EVMC_REVERT)  => "EVMC_REVERT"
```

### Other Codes

The following codes indicate other non-execution errors with the VM.

-   `EVMC_REJECTED` indicates malformed or wrong-version EVM bytecode.
-   `EVMC_INTERNAL_ERROR` indicates some other error that is unrecoverable but not due to the bytecode.
-   `.StatusCode` is an extra code added for "unset or unknown".

```k
    syntax StatusCode ::= EndStatusCode
                        | "EVMC_REJECTED"
                        | "EVMC_INTERNAL_ERROR"
                        | ".StatusCode"
 // -----------------------------------
    rule StatusCode2String(EVMC_REJECTED)       => "EVMC_REJECTED"
    rule StatusCode2String(EVMC_INTERNAL_ERROR) => "EVMC_INTERNAL_ERROR"
    rule StatusCode2String(.StatusCode)         => ""
```

Client/Network Codes
--------------------

The following are status codes used to report network state failures to the EVM from the client.
These are not present in the [EVM-C API].

-   `EVMC_ACCOUNT_ALREADY_EXISTS` indicates that a newly created account already exists.
-   `EVMC_BALANCE_UNDERFLOW` indicates an attempt to create an account which already exists.

```k
    syntax ExceptionalStatusCode ::= "EVMC_ACCOUNT_ALREADY_EXISTS"
                                   | "EVMC_BALANCE_UNDERFLOW"
 // ---------------------------------------------------------
    rule StatusCode2String(EVMC_ACCOUNT_ALREADY_EXISTS) => "EVMC_ACCOUNT_ALREADY_EXISTS"
    rule StatusCode2String(EVMC_BALANCE_UNDERFLOW)      => "EVMC_BALANCE_UNDERFLOW"
```

```k
endmodule
```
