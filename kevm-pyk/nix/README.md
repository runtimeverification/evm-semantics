## Notes
#### git submodules
If you use git submodules that are not required for building the project with `nix`, then you should add these directories to the `gitignoreSourcePure` list in `nix/kevm-pyk/default.nix`, see the respective left-over `TODO` in the nix file. Otherwise, the nix build that is uploaded to the nix binary cache by CI might not match the version that is requested by `kup`, in case this project is offered as a package by `kup`. This is due to weird behaviour in regards to git submodules by `git` and `nix`, where a submodule directory might exist and be empty or instead not exist, which impacts the resulting nix hash, which is of impartance when offering/downloading cached nix derivations. See [runtimeverification/k/pull/4804](https://github.com/runtimeverification/k/pull/4804) for more information.
