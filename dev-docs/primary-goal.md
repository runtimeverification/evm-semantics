\section{Evaluation}\label{sec:evaluation}

To demonstrate the effectiveness of our semantics summarization approach, we design an evaluation that addresses two fundamental questions critical to validating semantic summarization frameworks. The evaluation structure reflects the dual nature of our contribution: we introduce both a general-purpose summarization methodology and demonstrate its concrete benefits through EVM semantics optimization.

Our evaluation strategy is motivated by the following considerations. First, as a novel semantic transformation technique, our approach must prove its technical soundness and computational feasibility—establishing that the framework can reliably generate correct summarized semantics within practical time constraints. Second, the ultimate value of semantic summarization lies in its real-world impact on semantic-based tools and applications, requiring validation of the claimed benefits from consolidating modular semantics into user-friendly forms.

We structure our evaluation around two complementary research questions that capture these essential validation requirements:

\noindent\textbf{RQ1: Framework Effectiveness and Efficiency} -- How effective and efficient is our semantics summarization approach?

This question validates the technical viability of our framework by examining its ability to successfully process complex language semantics, measuring computational costs, and assessing the quality of semantic consolidation achieved. This evaluation is essential to establish that our approach represents a practical advancement in semantic optimization rather than a theoretical concept with prohibitive computational requirements.

\noindent\textbf{RQ2: Practical Benefits} -- What practical benefits does the summarized EVM semantics provide?

This question validates the practical value proposition of semantic summarization by measuring concrete improvements in execution performance, verification efficiency, and semantic usability. This evaluation is crucial to demonstrate that the computational investment in summarization yields tangible benefits for semantic-based tools and downstream applications.

We employ EVM semantics as our primary case study because it represents a compelling test case for semantic summarization: EVM exhibits the modular complexity that motivates our approach while being sufficiently well-specified to enable rigorous evaluation. The EVM's practical importance in blockchain systems, combined with the existence of production tools that rely on EVM semantics—such as smart contract verification frameworks like Kontrol—ensures that performance improvements have immediate real-world relevance for existing semantic-based tools. Our evaluation methodology combines quantitative performance measurements with qualitative assessments of practical utility, systematically applying our framework across EVM opcodes of varying complexity to validate both technical capabilities and practical benefits.

\subsection{RQ1: Framework Effectiveness and Efficiency}

To evaluate the technical viability of our semantics summarization approach, we analyze its effectiveness and efficiency across EVM opcodes of varying complexity, examining both correctness and computational performance characteristics.

\subsubsection{Experimental Setup}

We evaluate our summarization framework using the KEVM semantics definition, covering 144 EVM opcodes across six functional categories: arithmetic, logical, memory, storage, control flow, and environmental operations. The opcodes range from simple arithmetic operations like \texttt{ADD} to complex operations like \texttt{CREATE2} that involve multiple subsystems.

Our evaluation platform uses a compute cluster with 64-core Intel Xeon processors and 256GB RAM, running Ubuntu 22.04 LTS with K framework version 6.0.0. All experiments use consistent configurations and standardized timeout limits to ensure reproducible results.

\subsubsection{Effectiveness Analysis}

We measure framework effectiveness through three primary metrics:

\textbf{Success Rate:} The percentage of opcodes for which our framework successfully generates complete summarized semantics without errors or timeouts.

\textbf{Semantic Correctness:} The preservation of original semantic behavior, verified through concrete execution testing using KEVM's existing test suite and formal compliance verification. We employ both approaches because concrete testing validates practical correctness on real execution traces, while formal verification ensures theoretical soundness across all possible inputs, providing complementary confidence in semantic equivalence.

\textbf{Rewriting Steps Reduction:} The compression achieved by eliminating intermediate rewriting steps when using summarized semantics compared to the original modular semantics. This metric directly quantifies the core benefit of summarization—reducing the computational overhead of semantic evaluation by consolidating multi-step modular computations into single-step summarized rules.

Table~\ref{tab:framework-effectiveness} presents the effectiveness results across opcode categories, showing high success rates particularly for arithmetic and logical operations.

\begin{table}[htbp]

\caption{Framework Effectiveness Results by Opcode Category}
\label{tab:framework-effectiveness}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Opcode Category} & \textbf{Total} & \textbf{Success Rate} & \textbf{Concrete Tests} & \textbf{Step Reduction} \\
\textbf{} & \textbf{Opcodes} & \textbf{(\%)} & \textbf{Passed (\%)} & \textbf{(\%)} \\
\hline
Arithmetic & 20 & -- & -- & -- \\
Logical & 18 & -- & -- & -- \\
Memory & 15 & -- & -- & -- \\
Storage & 12 & -- & -- & -- \\
Control Flow & 25 & -- & -- & -- \\
Environmental & 54 & -- & -- & -- \\
\hline
\textbf{Overall} & \textbf{144} & \textbf{--} & \textbf{--} & \textbf{--} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

It is worth noting that our summarization framework extends beyond EVM semantics to other formal language semantics within the K framework ecosystem. Among all summarization steps, only the initial specification construction phase is language-specific, while all subsequent steps operate at a semantics-agnostic level through generic APIs we have implemented in the K framework. This design ensures broad applicability and allows the substantial engineering effort to be amortized across multiple language semantics.

\subsubsection{Efficiency Analysis}

Framework efficiency is evaluated through two key performance metrics:

\textbf{Processing Time:} The wall-clock time required to generate summarized semantics for each opcode, determining the practical feasibility for large-scale semantic definitions.

\textbf{Memory Consumption:} Peak memory usage during the summarization process, indicating the scalability to more complex semantic structures and larger instruction sets.

Figure~\ref{fig:processing-time-distribution} shows the processing time distribution across all evaluated opcodes. Most opcodes are processed within seconds, with a long tail for complex instructions that still remain within practical bounds.

Figure~\ref{fig:memory-consumption} shows the memory consumption distribution across evaluated opcodes. Memory usage scales predictably with semantic complexity, with most opcodes requiring modest resources even for complex structures.

\subsection{RQ2: Practical Benefits}

To validate the practical value proposition of semantic summarization, we evaluate improvements in execution performance, verification efficiency, and semantic interoperability. Our evaluation demonstrates that summarized EVM semantics provide tangible benefits for semantic-based tools and downstream applications.

\subsubsection{Experimental Setup}

We evaluate practical benefits using representative EVM programs across different complexity levels: simple arithmetic contracts, complex DeFi protocols, and gas-intensive operations. {\color{gray}Our test suite includes 50 real-world smart contracts from popular DeFi protocols, covering diverse opcode usage patterns and execution scenarios.}

Performance measurements are conducted on the same compute cluster as RQ1, with additional benchmarking using production-grade verification tools. We compare execution times between original modular KEVM semantics and our summarized semantics across both concrete and symbolic execution scenarios.

\subsubsection{Concrete Execution Performance}

We measure concrete execution performance improvements by comparing execution times of EVM programs using original versus summarized semantics. This evaluation directly quantifies the computational benefits of eliminating intermediate rewriting steps during program execution.

{\color{brown}
\textbf{Evaluation Options:} Multiple approaches can be used to assess concrete execution performance:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{KEVM Concrete Test Suite:} Direct comparison using existing KEVM concrete execution tests
\item \textbf{Real-world Smart Contracts:} Benchmarking with deployed contracts from popular DeFi protocols
\item \textbf{Synthetic Benchmarks:} Custom programs designed to stress-test specific opcode categories
\item \textbf{Gas Usage Analysis:} Measuring execution step reduction in terms of gas consumption patterns
\end{itemize}
}

Table~\ref{tab:concrete-performance} presents concrete execution performance improvements across different program categories. {\color{gray}The results demonstrate significant speedups, with particularly notable improvements for arithmetic-heavy and control-flow-intensive programs that benefit most from rule consolidation.}

\begin{table}[htbp]

\caption{Concrete Execution Performance Improvements}
\label{tab:concrete-performance}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Program Category} & \textbf{Test Programs} & \textbf{Avg. Speedup} & \textbf{Max Speedup} & \textbf{Reduction in} \\
\textbf{} & \textbf{} & \textbf{(x)} & \textbf{(x)} & \textbf{Rewriting Steps (\%)} \\
\hline
Arithmetic Heavy & 12 & -- & -- & -- \\
Memory Operations & 8 & -- & -- & -- \\
Storage Operations & 10 & -- & -- & -- \\
Control Flow & 15 & -- & -- & -- \\
Mixed Operations & 5 & -- & -- & -- \\
\hline
\textbf{Overall} & \textbf{50} & \textbf{--} & \textbf{--} & \textbf{--} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Symbolic Execution Performance}

Symbolic execution performance is evaluated by measuring the efficiency improvements in formal verification and symbolic analysis tasks. We assess the impact of summarized semantics on constraint generation, path exploration, and proof search processes.

{\color{brown}
\textbf{Evaluation Options:} Several evaluation approaches are available depending on the specific testing infrastructure:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{KEVM Test Suite Integration:} Leverage existing KEVM test cases for direct performance comparison
\item \textbf{Kontrol Verification Benchmarks:} Use smart contract verification tasks from the Kontrol framework
\item \textbf{Symbolic Execution Benchmarks:} Custom symbolic execution scenarios targeting specific opcode patterns
\item \textbf{Constraint Solver Integration:} Measure constraint generation efficiency and solver performance
\end{itemize}
}

Figure~\ref{fig:symbolic-performance} shows the symbolic execution performance comparison between original and summarized semantics across programs of varying complexity. The results demonstrate that summarized semantics significantly reduce the computational overhead of symbolic reasoning by eliminating redundant intermediate symbolic steps.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
% Figure content placeholder - symbolic execution performance comparison
\caption{Symbolic Execution Performance Comparison}
\label{fig:symbolic-performance}
\end{figure}

The efficiency improvements are particularly pronounced for complex programs that involve multiple opcode interactions, where the original modular semantics would require extensive intermediate symbolic computations that are eliminated in the summarized version.

{\color{gray}
\textbf{Tool Integration Benefits:} Beyond raw performance improvements, summarized semantics provide practical benefits for semantic-based tools and applications. The summarized semantics enable more efficient integration with verification tools like Kontrol, reducing the complexity of semantic reasoning required for smart contract verification. Users benefit from faster verification times and reduced computational resource requirements while maintaining the same level of formal guarantees.

\subsubsection{Semantic Equivalence Validation}

To establish the broader applicability and correctness of our approach, we validate the equivalence between our summarized KEVM semantics and alternative EVM implementations. Specifically, we demonstrate equivalence with Nethermind's EvmYul model, providing cross-validation of our semantic summarization approach.

We employ the formal verification framework from the [EVM Equivalence project](https://github.com/runtimeverification/evm-equivalence), which provides a mathematical foundation for comparing EVM implementations across different specification languages. This framework enables equivalence proofs between KEVM (specified in K) and EvmYul (specified in Lean 4) through automated Lean 4 code generation from K definitions.

{\color{brown}
\textbf{Equivalence Validation Approaches:} Several methods are available for cross-validation:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Automated Lean 4 Proof Generation:} Using the klean tool to generate and verify equivalence proofs
\item \textbf{Behavioral Equivalence Testing:} Comparative execution on identical test cases across implementations
\item \textbf{Symbolic Equivalence Checking:} Formal verification of behavioral equivalence using theorem proving
\item \textbf{Differential Testing:} Systematic comparison of outputs across diverse EVM implementations
\end{itemize}
}

Table~\ref{tab:equivalence-validation} presents the equivalence validation results across EVM opcodes, {\color{gray}demonstrating that our summarized semantics maintain behavioral equivalence with established EVM implementations while providing computational benefits.}

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\caption{Equivalence Validation with EvmYul}
\label{tab:equivalence-validation}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Opcode Category} & \textbf{Opcodes Tested} & \textbf{Equivalence Proofs} & \textbf{Validation} \\
\textbf{} & \textbf{} & \textbf{Completed} & \textbf{Success Rate (\%)} \\
\hline
Arithmetic & 20 & -- & -- \\
Logical & 18 & -- & -- \\
Memory & 15 & -- & -- \\
Storage & 12 & -- & -- \\
Control Flow & 25 & -- & -- \\
Environmental & 54 & -- & -- \\
\hline
\textbf{Overall} & \textbf{144} & \textbf{--} & \textbf{--} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The evaluation demonstrates that summarized EVM semantics provide substantial practical benefits across multiple dimensions: concrete execution efficiency, symbolic reasoning performance, and tool integration simplicity. These improvements validate the practical value of our semantic summarization approach and establish its utility for production semantic-based systems.
