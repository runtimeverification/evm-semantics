KEVM: Semantics of EVM in K
===========================

In this repository, we provide a model of the EVM in K.

Fast Installation
-----------------

-   `bash <(curl https://kframework.org/install)`: install [kup package manager].
-   `kup install kevm`: install KEVM.
-   `kup list kevm`: list available KEVM versions.
-   `kup update kevm`: update to latest KEVM version.

**NOTE**: The first run will take longer to fetch all the libraries and compile sources. (30m to 1h)

Repository Structure
--------------------

The following files constitute the KEVM semantics:

-   [network.md](kevm-pyk/src/kevm_pyk/kproj/evm-semantics/network.md) provides the status codes reported to an Ethereum client on execution exceptions.
-   [json-rpc.md](kevm-pyk/src/kevm_pyk/kproj/evm-semantics/json-rpc.md) is an implementation of JSON RPC in K.
-   [evm-types.md](kevm-pyk/src/kevm_pyk/kproj/evm-semantics/evm-types.md) provides the (functional) data of EVM (256-bit words, wordstacks, etc...).
-   [serialization.md](kevm-pyk/src/kevm_pyk/kproj/evm-semantics/serialization.md) provides helpers for parsing and unparsing data (hex strings, recursive-length prefix, Merkle trees, etc.).
-   [evm.md](kevm-pyk/src/kevm_pyk/kproj/evm-semantics/evm.md) is the main KEVM semantics, containing EVM’s configuration and transition rules.
-   [gas.md](kevm-pyk/src/kevm_pyk/kproj/evm-semantics/gas.md) contains all information relevant to gas.
-   [schedule.md](kevm-pyk/src/kevm_pyk/kproj/evm-semantics/schedule.md) contains all information relevant to EVM schedules.

These additional files extend the semantics to make the repository more useful:

-   [buf.md](kevm-pyk/src/kevm_pyk/kproj/evm-semantics/buf.md) defines the `#buf` byte-buffer abstraction for use during symbolic execution.
-   [abi.md](kevm-pyk/src/kevm_pyk/kproj/evm-semantics/abi.md) defines the [Contract ABI Specification](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.22/abi-spec.html) for use in proofs and easy contract/function specification.
-   [hashed-locations.md](kevm-pyk/src/kevm_pyk/kproj/evm-semantics/hashed-locations.md) defines the `#hashedLocation` abstraction used to specify Solidity-generated storage layouts.
-   [edsl.md](kevm-pyk/src/kevm_pyk/kproj/evm-semantics/edsl.md) combines the previous three abstractions for ease-of-use.

These files are used for testing the semantics itself:

-   [state-utils.md](kevm-pyk/src/kevm_pyk/kproj/evm-semantics/state-utils.md) provides functionality for EVM initialization, setup, and querying.
-   [driver.md](kevm-pyk/src/kevm_pyk/kproj/evm-semantics/driver.md) is an execution harness for KEVM, providing a simple language for describing tests/programs.

Building from source
--------------------

There are two backends of K available: LLVM for concrete execution and Haskell for symbolic execution.
This repository generates the build-products for each backend in `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/evm-semantics-<digest>`.

### System Dependencies

Run `install-build-deps` to install the required OS-supplied dependencies.

There are some additional notes for specific systems:

Ubuntu:
- The script works for ≥ 22.04.
- On Ubuntu < 18.04, you'll need to skip `libsecp256k1-dev` and instead
  build it from source (via our `Makefile`) using `make libsecp256k1`.

Arch:
- No issues known.

MacOS:
- After installing the Command Line Tools, [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/),
  and getting the [blockchain plugin](#blockchain-plugin), run:
- **NOTE**: It is recommended to use the homebrew version of `flex` and
  XCode.
- If you are building on an Apple Silicon machine, ensure that your `PATH`
  is set up correctly before running `make deps` or `make k-deps`. You can
  do so using [`direnv`](https://direnv.net/) by copying `macos-envrc` to
  `.envrc`, then running `direnv allow`.
- If the build on macOS still fails, you can also try adding the following
  lines to the top of your `Makefile` under `UNAME_S`:

      ifeq ($(UNAME_S), Darwin)
      SHELL := /usr/local/bin/bash
      PATH := $(pwd)/.build/usr/bin:$(PATH)
      endif

#### Haskell Stack (all platforms)

-   [Haskell Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/#installupgrade).
    Note that the version of the `stack` tool provided by your package manager might not be recent enough.
    Please follow installation instructions from the Haskell Stack website linked above.

To upgrade `stack` (if needed):

```sh
stack upgrade
export PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH
```

### Build Dependencies

#### K Framework

You need to install the [K Framework] on your system, see the instructions there.
The fastest way is via the [kup package manager], with which you can do to get the correct version of K:

```sh
kup install k.openssl --version v$(cat deps/k_release)
```

You can also drop into a single development shell with the correct version of K on path by doing:

```sh
kup shell k.openssl --version v$(cat deps/k_release)
```

### Building

First you need to set up a virtual environment using Poetry with the prerequisites `python 3.8.*`, `pip >= 20.0.2`, `poetry >= 1.3.2`:

```sh
make poetry
```

#### Blockchain Plugin

You also need to get the blockchain plugin submodule and install it.

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
poetry -C kevm-pyk run kdist --verbose build evm-semantics.plugin
```

To change the default compiler:

```sh
CXX=clang++-15 poetry -C kevm-pyk run kdist --verbose build evm-semantics.plugin
```

On Apple silicon:

```sh
APPLE_SILICON=true poetry -C kevm-pyk run kdist --verbose build evm-semantics.plugin
```

#### K Definitions

Finally, you can build the semantics.

```sh
poetry -C kevm-pyk run kdist --verbose build -j6
```

You can build specific targets using options `evm-semantics.{llvm,kllvm,kllvm-runtime,haskell,haskell-standalone,plugin}`, e.g.:

```sh
poetry -C kevm-pyk run kdist build -j2 evm-semantics.llvm evm-semantics.haskell
```

Targets can be cleaned with

```sh
poetry -C kevm-pyk run kdist clean
```

For more information, refer to `kdist --help` and the [dist.py](kevm-pyk/src/kevm_pyk/dist.py) module.

#### Easy `Makefile` build.

Run `make evm-semantics` for direct build of the target `libkevm/libkevm.so` library. As a dependency, the `lib/krypto.a` will be also build.
Run `make clean` to clean up the results of `make evm-semantics` command.

Running Tests
-------------

To execute tests from the [Ethereum Test Set], the submodule needs to be fetched first.

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive  -- tests/ethereum-tests
```

The tests are run using the supplied `Makefile`.

The following subsume all other tests:

-   `make test`: All of the quick tests.
-   `make test-all`: All of the quick and slow tests.

These are the individual test-suites (all of these can be suffixed with `-all` to also run slow tests):

-   `make test-vm`: VMTests from the [Ethereum Test Set].
-   `make test-bchain`: Subset of BlockchainTests from the [Ethereum Test Set].
-   `make test-proof`: Proofs from the [Verified Smart Contracts].
-   `make test-interactive`: Tests of the `kevm` command.

All these targets call `pytest` under the hood. You can pass additional arguments to the call by appending them to variable `PYTEST_ARGS`. E.g. run

```
make test-vm PYTEST_ARGS+=-vv
```

to execute VMTests with increased verbosity, and

```
make test-vm PYTEST_ARGS+=-n0
```

to execute them on a single worker.

Files produced by test runs, e.g. kompiled definition and logs, can be found in `/tmp/pytest-of-<user>/`.

For Developers
--------------

If built from the source, the `kevm-pyk` executable will be installed in a virtual environment handled by Poetry.
You can call `kevm-pyk --help` to get a quick summary of how to use the script.

Run the file `tests/ethereum-tests/BlockchainTests/GeneralStateTests/VMTests/vmArithmeticTest/add0.json`:

```sh
poetry -C kevm-pyk run kevm-pyk run tests/ethereum-tests/BlockchainTests/GeneralStateTests/VMTests/vmArithmeticTest/add0.json --schedule HOMESTEAD --mode VMTESTS
```

To enable the debug symbols for the llvm backend, build using this command:

```sh
poetry -C kevm-pyk run kdist build evm-semantics.llvm --arg enable-llvm-debug=true
```

To debug a conformance test, add the `--debugger` flag to the command:

```sh
poetry -C kevm-pyk run kevm-pyk run tests/ethereum-tests/BlockchainTests/GeneralStateTests/stExample/add11.json --target llvm --mode NORMAL --schedule CANCUN --chainid 1 --debugger
```

### Keeping in mind while developing

Always have your build up-to-date.

- If using the kup package manager, run `kup install kevm --version .` to install the local version.
- If building from source:
    -   `make poetry` needs to be re-run if you touch any of the `kevm-pyk` code.
    -   `poetry -C kevm-pyk run kdist build <target> --force` needs to be re-run if you touch any of this repos files.
    -   `poetry -C kevm-pyk run kdist clean` is a safe way to remove the target directory

### Building with Nix

We now support building KEVM using [nix flakes](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Flakes).
To set up nix flakes you will need to be on `nix` 2.4 or higher and follow the instructions [here](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes).

For example, if you are on a standard Linux distribution, such as Ubuntu, first [install nix](https://nixos.org/download.html#download-nix)
and then enable flakes by editing either `~/.config/nix/nix.conf` or `/etc/nix/nix.conf` and adding:

```
experimental-features = nix-command flakes
```

This is needed to expose the Nix 2.0 CLI and flakes support that are hidden behind feature-flags.

By default, Nix will build the project and its transitive dependencies from source, which can take up to an hour.
We recommend setting up [the binary cache](https://app.cachix.org/cache/kore) to speed up the build process significantly.

To build KEVM, run:

```sh
nix build .#kevm
```

This will build all of KEVM and K and put a link to the resulting binaries in the `result/` folder.


**NOTE**: Mac users, especially those running M1/M2 Macs may find nix segfaulting on occasion. If this happens, try running the nix command like this: `GC_DONT_GC=1 nix build .`

If you want to temporarily add the `kevm` binary to the current shell, run

```sh
nix shell .#kevm
```

### Profiling with Nix

Nix can also be used to quickly profile different versions of the Haskell backend. Simply run:

```sh
nix build github:runtimeverification/evm-semantics#profile \
  --override-input k-framework/haskell-backend github:runtimeverification/haskell-backend/<HASH> \
  -o prof-<HASH>
```

replacing `<HASH>` with the commit you want to run profiling against.

If you want to profile against a working version of the Haskell backend repository, simply `cd` into the root of the repo and run:

```sh
nix build github:runtimeverification/evm-semantics#profile \
  --override-input k-framework/haskell-backend $(pwd) \
  -o prof-my-feature
```

To compare profiles, you can use:

```sh
nix run github:runtimeverification/evm-semantics#compare-profiles -- prof-my-feature prof-<HASH>
```

This will produce a nice table with the times for both versions of the haskell-backend.
Note that `#profile` pre-pends the output of `kore-exec --version` to the profile run, which is then used as a tag by the `#compare-profiles` script.
Therefore, any profiled local checkout of the haskell-backend will report as `dirty-ghc8107` in the resulting table.

Media
-----

This repository can build two pieces of documentation for you, the [Jello Paper] and the [2017 Devcon3] presentation.

### System Dependencies

For the presentations in the `media` directory, you'll need `pdflatex`, commonly provided with `texlive-full`, and `pandoc`.

```sh
sudo apt install texlive-full pandoc
```

### Building

To build all the PDFs (presentations and reports) available in the `media/` directory, use:

```sh
make media
```
